Purpose
    
    This is a fork of https://github.com/danakj/openbox. If you want to 
    play games or videos (using VLC/GStreamer/etc) fullscreen across
    multiple monitors then this patch is for you. This feature is
    similar to what is already available in Windows for a feature called
    Collage Mode or now Combined Desktop via Intel Graphics Command Center.
    This patch doesn't have any Bezel Correction and likely a future project
    to have some fun with :-)

Useful notes

    Make sure to use xrandr or arandr to set the desired layout and 
    resolutions/refresh rates for your monitors.  
    
    To customize your Openbox environment refer to this really good tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Openbox.
    This project already customizes the menu.xml file but the original is still
    available (menu-orig.xml).


    Replace openbox-session with openbox-session-dbg if you need to debug Openbox WM. 
    This will enable all debug messages to be logged to $HOME/ob-session.log.
    
    
    I have built and tested this on Ubuntu 20.04. To build this project you must
    have the typical apt install -y build-essential installed. To build simply 
    execute the below steps. Reference http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Installing 
    for further help.
    
    cd openbox
    ./boostrap
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
    make
    make install
